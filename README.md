## The prupose of this project is to discover trends in a 10 team fantasy football dynasty league over a two year period. the project hopes to discover the trends between winning and losing teams, how much luck is involved in the league, and the probablility of winning for each score over a two year period. Only data from the regualar season was used. The league's regular season is 14 games, which means each team has played 28 total games over a two year period. 
## The league has a mean score of 186.17 points per game, a median score of 184.45 points per week, and a standard deviation of 30.00895 points. We now know that our data is essentially normally distributed given how close the mean and median score are to one another.

## Win probability based on points scored 
# ![Win probability plot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92fe7031-1c1e-428d-8083-a52fcb890ef5)
## it was found that scoring 150 points or less gives a team less than a 20% chance to win. There is a steep increase in win probability from 150 points scored or less until a teams scores 170 points. From 170 points scored-200 points scored the win probability increases steadlily. Once a team scores 200 points, they have a win proability of about 75% and the win probability has steep increaes as points scored goes beyond 200 points 

# 2023 Matt vs 2024 Josh 
## in 2023, Matt was the league champion while leading the league in points scored and wins. In 2024, Josh was by far the best team in the league and had a 13-1 record in the regular season, unfortunately for Josh he ran into a red hot team in the playoffs and despite his team putting up a valiant performance, he fell short of winning a championship. Despite not winning a championship, his greatness did not go unnoticed and I decided to run a simulation of these two titans to see which team had the better year. I ran a simulation of 10 14 game seasons to determine who had the better team.
